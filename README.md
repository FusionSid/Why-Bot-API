# Why-Bot-API
API I will use to access the db when I make the dashboard | Also I rewrote and merged the filehost api with this api


since i store my data in sqlite files i cant acess them from outside. So i made an api so when i do make the web dashboard for my bot i will use the api to get data
from my bot.

Also this is a file hosting api too.  
I basicly took my old file hosting api and merged it with this so i can get 2 apis on the same link/domain.

This api lets you give a file and it will delete the file after 24h.  
It supports many differnt file types, and i plan to add more.

Also i will add a ui for the file hosting thing which lets you have logins and stuff. (probbaly login with discord cause im too lazy)
